%% However, be warned that pdflatex will require graphics to be in PDF
%% (not EPS) format and will preclude the use of PostScript based LaTeX

%% allow PDF graphics (and hence pdfLaTeX). However, IEEE journals do not
%% (yet) allow image formats other than EPS or TIFF. Therefore, authors of

%%
%% The path(s) to the graphics files can also be declared: e.g.,
%% \graphicspath{{../eps/}{../ps/}}
%% if the graphics files are not located in the same directory as the
%% .tex file. This can be done in each branch of the conditional above
%% (after graphicx is loaded) to handle the EPS and PDF cases separately.
%% In this way, full path information will not have to be specified in

%% Note that, when switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the new
%% compiler will have to be run twice to clear some warnings.

%                        % preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline
%                        % equations. Use:
\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
%                        % after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks
%                        % as IEEEtran.cls normally does. amsmath.sty is already
%                        % installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version
%                        % and documentation can be obtained at:

%% Other popular packages for formatting tables and equations include:

\usepackage{array}
%% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty which improves the
%% LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better appearances and
%% additional user controls. array.sty is already installed on most systems.
%% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
%% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/
%
%% Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools, especially mdwmath.sty and
%% mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations and tables, respectively.
%% The MDWtools set is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The lastest
%% version and documentation is available at:

%
%
%% V1.6 of IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can

%
%% Notes on hyperref:
%% IEEEtran.cls attempts to be compliant with the hyperref package, written
%% by Heiko Oberdiek and Sebastian Rahtz, which provides hyperlinks within
%% a document as well as an index for PDF files (produced via pdflatex).
%% However, it is a tad difficult to properly interface LaTeX classes and
%% packages with this (necessarily) complex and invasive package. It is
%% recommended that hyperref not be used for work that is to be submitted
%% to the IEEE. Users who wish to use hyperref *must* ensure that their
%% hyperref version is 6.72u or later *and* IEEEtran.cls is version 1.6b
%% or later. The latest version of hyperref can be obtained at:
%%
%% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/hyperref/
%%
%% Also, be aware that cite.sty (as of version 3.9, 11/2001) and hyperref.sty
%% (as of version 6.72t, 2002/07/25) do not work optimally together.
%% To mediate the differences between these two packages, IEEEtran.cls, as
%% of v1.6b, predefines a command that fools hyperref into thinking that
%% the natbib package is being used - causing it not to modify the existing
%% citation commands, and allowing cite.sty to operate as normal. However,
%% as a result, citation numbers will not be hyperlinked. Another side effect
%% of this approach is that the natbib.sty package will not properly load
%% under IEEEtran.cls. However, current versions of natbib are not capable
%% of compressing and sorting citation numbers in IEEE's style - so this
%% should not be an issue. If, for some strange reason, the user wants to
%% load natbib.sty under IEEEtran.cls, the following code must be placed
%% before natbib.sty can be loaded:
%%
%% \makeatletter
%% \let\NAT@parse\undefined
%% \makeatother
%%
%% Hyperref should be loaded differently depending on whether pdflatex
%% or traditional latex is being used:
%%
% \ifx\pdfoutput\undefined
% \usepackage[hypertex]{hyperref}
% \else
% \usepackage[pdftex,hypertexnames=false]{hyperref}
% \fi
%%
%% Pdflatex produces superior hyperref results and is the recommended
%% compiler for such use.
%
%
%
%% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
%% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
%% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

%% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
%% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as

%%
%% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
%% \PARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
%%
%% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
%% normal text (unknown if ever used by IEEE):
%% \PARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
%%
%% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
%% \PARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
%%
%% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
%% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
%\PARstart{T}{his} demo file is intended to serve as a ``starter
%file" for IEEE journal papers produced under \LaTeX\ using
%IEEEtran.cls version 1.6b and later.

%%
%% If you have an EPS/PDF photo (graphicx package needed) extra braces are
%% needed around the contents of the optional argument to biography to prevent

%% \includegraphics command within an optional argument. (You could create
%% your own custom macro containing the \includegraphics command to make things
%% simpler here.)
%%\begin{biography}[{\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1.25in,clip,keepaspectratio]{mshell}}]{Michael Shell}
%% where an .eps filename suffix will be assumed under latex, and a .pdf suffix
%% will be assumed for pdflatex; or if you just want to reserve a space for
%% a photo:
%
%\begin{biography}{Michael Shell}
%Biography text here.
%\end{biography}
%
%% if you will not have a photo at all:
%\begin{biographynophoto}{John Doe}
%Biography text here.
%\end{biographynophoto}
%
%% insert where needed to balance the two columns on the last page
%%\newpage
%
%\begin{biographynophoto}{Jane Doe}
%Biography text here.
%\end{biographynophoto}
%
%% You can push biographies down or up by placing
%% a \vfill before or after them. The appropriate
%% use of \vfill depends on what kind of text is
%% on the last page and whether or not the columns
%% are being equalized.
%
%%\vfill

%% Can be used to pull up biographies so that the bottom of the last one
%% is flush with the other column.
